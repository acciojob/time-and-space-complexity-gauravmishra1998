	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p> Time complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task (considering that each operation takes the same amount of time). The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity.</p>
   <p><b>Space Complexity</b>includes both auxiliary sp and sp used by the input. Auxiliary sp is the temporary or extra sp used by the algorithm while it is being executed. Sc an algorithm is commonly expressed using Big O (O(n)) notation.</p>
